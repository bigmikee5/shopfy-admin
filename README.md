# Shopify Admin Hackathon Challenge

I'm thrilled to share my successful completion of the Level Up Front Hackathon Challenge, an exhilarating journey into bringing the Figma design to life for Shopify's onboarding dashboard. Here are the key details:

## Challenge Highlights:

- **Challenge Name:** Level Up Front Hackathon Challenge
- **Technology Used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript
- **Description:** I undertook the challenge of recreating a production-ready dashboard based on the provided Figma design, tailored for Shopify's extensive merchant base of 1.75 million users. The focus was on ensuring a seamless experience for mouse users, keyboard-only users, and screen reader users. Additionally, I crafted a fully responsive design for both mobile phones and desktops, exclusively optimized for the Google Chrome browser.

My solution adhered to strict constraints, utilizing only three filesâ€”`index.html` for HTML, `app.css` for CSS, and `app.js` for Javascript. The challenge emphasized precision, with every text faithfully replicated from the Figma design for automatic submission evaluation.

A special thanks to our sponsor, Crushing Tech, for making this challenging yet rewarding experience possible.
